This tidy data set contains only the standard deviation in variables ending with std, and mean for variables ending in mean.

Variables will be from the following:

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccM
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag
